BUILD: Implement optimistic updates + debounced commits + snap-to-grid + boundaries in LayoutEditor.

Scope: Only client/src/pages/LayoutEditor.tsx (plus tiny helper inside same file if needed). No backend changes.

1) Optimistic updates (react-query)
- updateRoomMutation:
  - onMutate:
    - cancelQueries(["rooms", practiceId])
    - snapshot previous rooms
    - update cache immediately: replace the room with merged updates (x/y/width/height/name)
  - onError: rollback snapshot
  - onSuccess: update cache with server response (do NOT hard invalidate rooms)
  - onSettled: optionally invalidate(["rooms", practiceId]) only if needed (prefer not)

- deleteRoomMutation:
  - onMutate: remove room from cache immediately
  - onError rollback
  - onSuccess: keep cache as is
  - remove selectedRoomId if deleted

- createRoomMutation:
  - keep current behavior (invalidate rooms + select newRoom.id) OR do a simple optimistic temp room if easy.
  - Do not overcomplicate.

2) Stop request storms (name + sliders)
- Room name input:
  - do NOT call updateRoom on every key.
  - Use local state `roomNameDraft` synced when selectedRoom changes.
  - Commit to API onBlur AND also with debounce 400–600ms after last keystroke.

- Width/Height sliders:
  - Keep UI preview instant (local/cache update).
  - Send API update debounced (300–500ms) OR on pointer release.
  - If Slider has no onValueCommit, implement a debounced commit with setTimeout/useRef.

3) Debounce AI analysis invalidation
- Currently you invalidate ["ai-analysis", practiceId] on every update.
- Replace with a debounced invalidation (e.g. 1500–2500ms idle after last commit).
- Trigger it after successful commits (drag end commit, slider commit, name commit), not every preview tick.

4) Snap-to-grid + boundary clamp on drag end
- GRID_SIZE = 40 (matches background).
- Add a ref to the canvas container div (the big flex-1 area).
- On drag end compute:
  rawX = room.x + info.offset.x
  rawY = room.y + info.offset.y
- If Shift is pressed: no snap. Else:
  snapX = round(rawX/GRID_SIZE)*GRID_SIZE
  snapY = round(rawY/GRID_SIZE)*GRID_SIZE
- Clamp:
  maxX = canvasWidth - room.width
  maxY = canvasHeight - room.height
  finalX = clamp(snapX, 0, maxX)
  finalY = clamp(snapY, 0, maxY)
- Persist finalX/finalY via updateRoomMutation.

5) Output
- List changed files (should be 1).
- Short manual test plan:
  - drag room: no snap-back
  - resize slider: no network spam
  - type name: saves after pause/blur
  - drag to edges: room stays inside
  - wait 2s: ai-analysis refresh happens once
